Git
--------------------------------------------
Explain Git using diagram Josh used to explain to Sanford
Show instructions to setup Git in that manner


HelloWorld and syntax/control flow
--------------------------------------------
Discuss Sorting Lab First
After HelloWorld examples, show console.log()
After console.log(), give 2-3 tightly-packed examples showing all the syntax
After each example, give tutorial where the team has to individually fix all syntax issues and if standard algorithm, also fix logic issues
Skip slides discussing all the syntax in presentation, mark as reference
Round out best practices for syntax and control flow in one slide
After first quick test, make sure they are committing to their repository and pushing out to their github repo
Second example should include scoping, ensure there is a slide on that which is not skipped.

Types
--------------------------------------------
Discuss types and type coercion after examples
Have them do a couple in console.log() and mention the slides containing all the info as reference material

Short Labs rather than Quick Test
--------------------------------------------
For testing, give them a tutorial where some of the logic is incorrect and they have to write the unit tests and fix the logic

Sorting Lab
--------------------------------------------
Break up sorting into checkpoints
- Part 1 should be algorithm
  - Breakdown part 1 into smaller steps
  - Mention one iteration of outer loop in slides
- Part 2 should be testing
Create Lab for using the DOM

Post-Lab
--------------------------------------------
Add section about what mistakes we kept seeing in labs from day 1

Data Structures
--------------------------------------------
Mark Data Structures slides as reference material and briefly skim over it

River of News Lab
--------------------------------------------
Setup checkpoints during River of News Lab according to Workflow slide, ensure team is helping out each other on a per-step basis
Ensure team is helping out each other on a per-step basis for calculator

OOP
--------------------------------------------
Fix c.y = 2 showing c.y = 42 in the picture for "OOP - New Base"
Add pictures for Calculator and AdvCalculator in OOP slides

Calculator Lab
--------------------------------------------
Mention for util.js that you don't specify "on" for event handlers
Ensure team is helping out each other on a per-step basis for calculator
